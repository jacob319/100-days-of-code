    <h2>Things you can do to help</h2>
  <p>The less you print, the less paper is used. Trees are cut down for paper. Therefore, the less you print, the fewer trees are cut down. In the long run this could really add up to a lot of saved trees.In the same way that printing less causes less of a demand for paper, getting your bills through e-mail instead of a printed copy in the mail will decrease the demand for paper.Bamboo is easily sustainable and grows to maturity within five years, a lot faster than trees. They have exactly the same functions as well. Try to use bamboo paper as much as possible in order to lower the demand for paper produced by trees.</p>

    <h2>Organizations you want to donate </h2>
  <p>American Forests is the nation’s oldest nonprofit citizen conservation organization, founded in 1875. Their efforts helped create the National Park and National Forest systems in the U.S. Through the Global ReLeaf program, American Forests plants millions of trees each year and advocates the benefits of both rural and urban trees, good science, and sound policy. Learn about their plans for Global ReLeaf 2000 or take a virtual tour of famous and historic trees and forests. An order form on this site allows individuals to “plant a tree online” and help preserve threatened forest ecosystems.  ForestEthics protects endangered forests by transforming the paper and wood industries in North America and by supporting forest communities in the development of conservation-based economies.</p>
