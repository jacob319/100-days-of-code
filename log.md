**Today's Progress:** I didn't do much but set up codepen, set up twitter and slack account, and used Scrimba Tutorial to learn about styling links

**Thoughts:** Today was a start kind of started slow but I feel like tomorrow will be a much better day since I know where to start. [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) is just great to start learning and during at the sametime.

### Day 2: March 26,2020

**Today's Progress:** Today learned more CSS: built simple buttons, created hover for links and buttons.
I continued to you Scrimba tutorials.

**Thoughts:** Today was bittersweet because today was my last day at work before lay-off. Anyways I felt better using CSS and using what I learned. I really enjoy Scrimba the teacher really breaks it down to make it easy to learn.
