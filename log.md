**Today's Progress:** Today learned more CSS: built simple buttons, created hover for links and buttons.
I continued to you Scrimba tutorials.

**Thoughts:** Today was bittersweet because today was my last day at work before lay-off. Anyways I felt better using CSS and using what I learned. I really enjoy Scrimba the teacher really breaks it down to make it easy to learn.

### Day 5: March 29,2020

**Today's Progress:** started learning some more flexbox, flexbox is cool but I know I need more practice. I followed Scrmba tutorial but tomorrow will try to build something.

### Day 6: March 30,2020


**Today's Progress:** learned more flexbox and media query, created a navbar with flexbox.

**Thoughts:** Today was another great day, learn more about flexbox and a little bit about media query. [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) is just great to start learning flexbox. Only issue I'm having is when to use margin, padding, and how much to use.

### Day 7: March 31,2020

**Today's Progress:** learned more flexbox and media query, followed freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** Today didn't have much motivation to code, but pushed through it. Mostly followed freecodecamp and learned media query and flexbox. I learned that I learn better at night which is strange anyway I think I'm building a habit.
